After submitting this form, you will receive a token that your application will use to identify itself to MediaWiki. An OAuth administrator will need to approve your application before it can be authorised by other users.\n\nA few recommendations and remarks:\n* Try to use as few grants as possible. Avoid grants that are not actually needed now.\n* Versions are of the form \"major.minor.release\" (the last two being optional) and increase as grant changes are needed.\n* Please provide a public RSA key (in PEM format) if possible; otherwise a (less secure) secret token will have to be used.\n* You can use a project ID to restrict the consumer to a single project on this site (use \"*\" for all projects).",
